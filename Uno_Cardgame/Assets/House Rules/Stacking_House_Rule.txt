In this variation, players may stack Draw 2 cards onto Draw 2 cards and Wild Draw 4 cards onto Wild Draw 4 cards. However, you cannot stack Draw 2 cards onto Wild Draw 4 cards and vice versa.[3]
This variation offers the opportunity for a bit more excitement, as the player at the end of the stack may end up having to draw even more cards.
